# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Initial Setup

After the app is generated, you need to set the admin user.

1. Create an account for `admin@masci.com` through the sign-up page in the app.
2. Open a new terminal in your workspace.
3. Run the following command to set the admin custom claim:

```bash
npm run set-admin
```

This will grant admin privileges to the user. You can now log in as the admin.
