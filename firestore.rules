/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for ExamplifyAI
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and achievements,
 *                  while allowing public read access to course content. Administrative access is not explicitly
 *                  defined but can be added by introducing a role-based access control mechanism.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Only the authenticated user can access their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/achievements/{achievementId}: Stores user-specific achievements. Only the authenticated user can access their own achievements.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information. Publicly readable.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}: Stores lesson information. Publicly readable.
 * - /modules/{moduleId}: Stores module information. Publicly readable.
 * - /chapters/{chapterId}: Stores chapter information. Publicly readable.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Stores question bank. Publicly readable.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam definitions. Publicly readable.
 * - /attempts/{attemptId}: Stores user exam attempts.  Only the user can create attempts for themselves; other users should not be able to create attempts on behalf of other users.
 * - /metrics/daily/{date}: Stores daily metrics. No specific write access is defined.
 * - /courseCompetencies/{courseCompetencyId}: Stores course competencies. Publicly readable.
 * - /masterCourses/{masterCourseId}: Stores master course definitions. Publicly readable.
 * - /masterCertificates/{masterCertificateId}: Stores issued master certificates. No write permissions are defined.
 * - /roadmaps/{roadmapId}: Stores roadmap definitions. Publicly readable.
 * - /schedules/{scheduleId}: Stores schedule events. No specific write access is defined.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quiz information. Publicly readable.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Users cannot list all user profiles (to protect privacy).
 * - Course content (courses, lessons, modules, chapters, questions, exams, courseCompetencies, roadmaps, quizzes) is publicly readable.
 * - The default security posture for collections without explicit rules is restrictive (no access).
 * - Authorization decisions are made based on the authenticated user's UID (`request.auth.uid`).
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization N/A - Denormalization is not used in this ruleset.
 * @structural_segregation N/A - Structural segregation is not used in this ruleset.
