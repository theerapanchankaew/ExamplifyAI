/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and achievements.
 *  It allows public read access to course-related data (courses, lessons, exams, quizzes) while restricting writes to authenticated users.
 *  Attempts are also restricted to authenticated users, ensuring that only they can create or modify their own attempt records.
 *  Daily metrics and master certificates are read/write restricted for prototyping.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, where userId must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Course information, publicly readable.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}: Lesson information, publicly readable.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Question bank, publicly readable.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Exam definitions, publicly readable.
 * - /attempts/{attemptId}: User exam attempts, restricted to the authenticated user.
 * - /metrics/daily/{date}: Daily metrics, restricted for prototyping.
 * - /courseCompetencies/{courseCompetencyId}: Course competencies, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/achievements/{userAchievementId}: User achievements, only accessible by the user.
 * - /masterCourses/{masterCourseId}: Master course definitions, publicly readable.
 * - /masterCertificates/{masterCertificateId}: Master certificates, restricted for prototyping.
 * - /roadmaps/{roadmapId}: Roadmap definitions, publicly readable.
 * - /schedules/{scheduleId}: Schedule events, publicly readable.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Quiz information, publicly readable.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to course-related data to allow open browsing of available content.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 * - Relational integrity is enforced on user-owned data to ensure consistency between the path and the document's internal userId field.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - User ownership is enforced by matching the `userId` in the path with `request.auth.uid`.
 * - No denormalization is necessary as ownership is directly verifiable from the path.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 * - User profiles and achievements are stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring private storage.
