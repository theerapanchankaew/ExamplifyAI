/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and achievements.
 *  All other collections are publicly readable but writable only by authenticated users,
 *  with no role-based access control (all authenticated users are treated equally).
 *
 *  Data Structure:
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where userId must match the authenticated user's UID.
 *  - /users/{userId}/achievements/{achievementId}: Stores achievements for a specific user.
 *  - All other top-level collections (e.g., /courses, /lessons, /exams): Store publicly readable data.
 *
 *  Key Security Decisions:
 *  - User listing is implicitly denied.
 *  - Public read access is granted to most collections, as the focus is on authorization
 *    rather than complete data hiding in this prototyping phase.
 *  - No schema validation is performed beyond ensuring relational integrity for ownership.
 *
 *  Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - User-owned documents enforce that the document ID matches the authenticated user's UID.
 *
 *  Structural Segregation:
 *  - Private user data (profiles, achievements) is stored under the /users/{userId} path for strict access control.
