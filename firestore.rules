/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Examplify20g
 * @version Prototyping
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and achievements, and applies public-read/owner-write patterns where appropriate.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the owning user (userId must match request.auth.uid).
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}: Stores lesson information. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Stores question data. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam definitions. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /attempts/{attemptId}: Stores user exam attempts. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /metrics/daily/{date}: Stores daily metrics. Write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role. Read access is public.
 * - /courseCompetencies/{courseCompetencyId}: Stores course competencies. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /users/{userId}/achievements/{userAchievementId}: Stores user achievements. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /masterCourses/{masterCourseId}: Stores master courses. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /masterCertificates/{masterCertificateId}: Stores master certificates. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /roadmaps/{roadmapId}: Stores roadmaps. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /schedules/{scheduleId}: Stores schedules. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quizzes. Read access is public, write access is not defined without a concrete ownership field, or an admin role.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted for courses, lessons, questions, exams, attempts, daily metrics, course competencies, master courses, master certificates, roadmaps, schedules, and quizzes.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - None explicitly defined.  If collaborative features are added, member lists or role maps should be denormalized directly onto shared documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User achievements are stored in a private user subcollection (/users/{userId}/achievements/{userAchievementId}) to ensure only the user can list or access them.
