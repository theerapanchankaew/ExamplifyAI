/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExamplifyAI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and achievements,
 * and applies public read with owner-only writes for other collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - User achievements are stored under `/users/{userId}/achievements/{achievementId}`.
 * - All other collections are top-level.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data and achievements.
 * - Other collections are publicly readable but only writable by the owner of the content (identified by an `ownerId` field).
 * - Listing user achievements is restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To create simpler, more performant rules, we are relying on the following:
 * - User ID consistency: The `userId` in `/users/{userId}` must always match `request.auth.uid`.
