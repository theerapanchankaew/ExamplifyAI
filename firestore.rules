/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExamplifyAI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data and allows public read access for shared resources.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - Course, Lesson, Question, Exam, Attempt, DailyMetrics, CourseCompetency, MasterCourse, MasterCertificate, Roadmap, Schedule, and Quiz data are stored in top-level collections with public read access.
 * - User achievements are stored under the user's profile in `/users/{userId}/achievements/{achievementId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data and achievements.
 * - Listing of attempts is allowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to course, lesson, question, exam, and related data.
 * - All write operations are protected by authorization checks to ensure data integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  No denormalization is needed in this basic ruleset.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  Private user data is stored in a subcollection under `/users/{userId}`, while shared data resides in top-level collections.
