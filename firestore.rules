/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExamplifyAI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a hybrid security model, balancing open access for some content collections
 * (e.g., questions) with strict user-ownership for personal data and admin-only access for
 * sensitive system data (e.g., metrics).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, secured via ownership.
 * - Learning content (courses, lessons, modules, chapters, questions, exams, quizzes, roadmaps)
 *   is stored in top-level collections, generally readable by anyone.
 * - User-specific data (attempts, achievements, master certificates) is stored under the
 *   corresponding `/users/{userId}` path and secured via ownership.
 * - System metrics are stored under `/metrics/daily/{date}` and write-protected.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to learning content collections to facilitate discovery.
 * - Ownership is enforced for all write operations on user-specific data.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during the prototyping phase to allow for schema iteration.
