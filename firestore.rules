/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for ExamplifyAI
 * @version Prototyping
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and achievements,
 * and allows public read access to courses, lessons, questions, exams, and roadmaps.
 * Exam attempts are restricted to the user who created them. Daily metrics and course
 * competencies are publicly accessible. Master courses, master certificates and schedules
 * can be created by anyone.
 *
 * @data-structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with `userId` matching `auth.uid`.
 * - /users/{userId}/achievements/{userAchievementId}: Stores user achievements.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}: Stores lesson information, related to a course by `courseId`.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Stores questions for exams and quizzes.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam definitions, related to a course by `courseId`.
 * - /attempts/{attemptId}: Stores user exam attempts, linked to a user by `userId` and an exam by `examId`.
 * - /metrics/daily/{date}: Stores daily metrics for the system. Document ID is the date in YYYYMMDD format.
 * - /courseCompetencies/{courseCompetencyId}: Stores the mapping between courses and competencies.
 * - /masterCourses/{masterCourseId}: Stores master course definitions.
 * - /masterCertificates/{masterCertificateId}: Stores issued master certificates, linked to a user by `userId` and a master course by `masterCourseId`.
 * - /roadmaps/{roadmapId}: Stores roadmap definitions.
 * - /schedules/{scheduleId}: Stores schedule events.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quiz information.
 *
 * @key-security-decisions
 * - User profiles are only accessible to the authenticated user.
 * - User achievements are only accessible to the authenticated user.
 * - Courses, lessons, questions, exams, roadmaps, course competencies, master courses, schedules, and quizzes are publicly readable.
 * - Exam attempts are restricted to the user who created them.
 * - Daily metrics are publicly readable.
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Write rules for all operations are explicitly defined.
 *
 * @denormalization-for-authorization
 * - Exam attempts store the `userId` to enforce user-specific access.
