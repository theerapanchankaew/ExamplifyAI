/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for ExamplifyAI
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 *                  and allows public read access to courses, lessons, questions, exams, and roadmaps.
 *                  Writes to non-user-owned data are generally disallowed to client applications.
 *
 * @data_structure Data is organized into top-level collections for global data (courses, lessons, etc.)
 *                 and user-specific subcollections under `/users/{userId}` for private data (achievements).
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is disabled to prevent unauthorized enumeration of users.
 *   - Public read access is granted for course, lesson, question, exam, and roadmap data. Writes are disallowed.
 *   - Daily metrics can only be read; writes are not permitted via client SDKs.
 *   - All user-specific data is stored under `/users/{userId}` and is accessible only to the authenticated user.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   - User-specific data (attempts, achievements, master certificates) includes the `userId` field,
 *     which is validated against the path to ensure ownership.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 *   - Private user achievements are stored in a subcollection `/users/{userId}/achievements/{achievementId}`
 *     while global course and roadmap data are stored in top-level collections.
