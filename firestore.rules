/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated data.
 *  All other data is publicly readable, but write access is restricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information; access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/achievements/{userAchievementId}: Stores user-specific achievements; accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}: Stores lesson information; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Stores question data; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam definitions; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /attempts/{attemptId}: Stores user attempts; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /metrics/daily/{date}: Stores daily metrics; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /courseCompetencies/{courseCompetencyId}: Stores course competencies; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /masterCourses/{masterCourseId}: Stores master courses; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /masterCertificates/{masterCertificateId}: Stores master certificates; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /roadmaps/{roadmapId}: Stores roadmaps; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /schedules/{scheduleId}: Stores schedules; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quizzes; publicly readable, write access restricted.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All top-level collections (courses, lessons, questions, etc.) are publicly readable to allow open access to content.
 * - Write access to these collections is denied to all users in this prototype. In a production environment, this would be restricted to administrative users.
 *
 * Access Control Patterns:
 * - /users/{userId}: Ownership (isOwner(userId))
 * - /users/{userId}/achievements/{userAchievementId}: Ownership (isOwner(userId))
 * - All other collections: Public Read with Owner-Only Writes (enforced through `allow write: if false;`)
